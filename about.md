# TRUK

Trucks are my young son's favorite thing. Thats whats with the name.
This repo is a collection of c that im writing to exercise c for the sake of itself
while i play with some language design. Its kind of an open ended project that will
revolve around language design and compilation. Im forcing myself to do it in c becuase
i now work as a c# developer (after being a c++ dev for years) so I figure it will help
to keep my c sharp.

for must_start_with. when false the check happens at the current position.
the returned index_of_start_symbol will point to the delimiter not the
whitespace

this provides the ability for us to get a view into something of a list "form"
without limiting us to JUST processing () [] {} etc. We can say parse this
group:   !a b +1 2$ where ! is start and $ is end then it also means we can do
"hello \"world!\"!" my providing '\' as the escape byte and having start AND end
both be: " Naturally this means we can also find () [] {} || <> etc provided
that the buffer position starts with the must_start_with so this enforces/
implies that the caller is doing something specific, and we just don't need to
know

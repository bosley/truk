    Types are produced by a scanner off a buffer. The types listed here
    do not own the data they point to. they point into a buffer. the owner
    of the buffer is to maintain/manage that memory

    static_base_e represents the MOST BASIC data possible. no lists. no dynamic
   implications just shit we can infer from a small state machine off of a
   buffer

    start
        - if buffer at pos = [- or +] check next. if int -> switch to int parse
   state and keep sign, else: symbol
        - if while reading int we get "." -> real reading state (still consuming
   ints)
        - if white space \n \t ' ' etc, we are done
        - if parsing ints and non-whitespace non-peiord shows up (special case
   for real) -> error

Its become evident that my process is 
"indicate concern with a "."" and do context-specific 
loading or setup so lets formalize it:


```
.segment         ; <- meaning a unique segment in which values are setup

                 ; in impl this could mean "i need a map"

; <symbol-name> <def> :: <def> = static base type or group
; then refine to s-group where 
resolution {
    "width":  800   ; <str-static-base-type> <symbol:> <stati-base-type-or-group>
    "height": 600
}

```
